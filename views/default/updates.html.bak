<h1>This is the updates page</h1>
<p>
    This is arguably the most important page of the website.
</p>
<p>
    Here the user will see a list of each comic they have subscribed to which has an update they have not yet read, with a number of how many unread pages are in each comic. Clicking on the link of a comic will take them to the first page of the comic they have not yet read, and update the user as having read that page.
